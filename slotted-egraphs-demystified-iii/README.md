# Chapter III - Symmetries
The next (and last) annoying case is that we might learn that `x+y = y+x`.
This is weird, as both sides of the equation are equal up to renaming.
We might try to to "just store them as normal nodes":

```
c0(x) := x
c1(x, y) := c0(x) + c0(y) | c0(y) + c0(x)
```

But this is not enough.
If you know look up the term `a+b`, there's actually two valid outputs. Either `c1(a, b)` or `c1(b, a)`.
Further, a (slotted) e-graph is supposed to "answer" equivalence questions, but if we get the outputs `c1(a, b)` and `c1(b, a)`, we really wouldn't know whether they are supposed to represent the same thing or not.
It depends on whether the class has nodes like `x+y | y+x` or not.
